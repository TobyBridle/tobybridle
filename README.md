# Woah, fancy seeing you here! üëã

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a few things, most notably:
**URL Shortener**  
[A not-so-basic URL shortener using SvelteKit on the Frontend, Rust and Rocket for the API, Postgres and then NGINX to reverse-proxy them all together](https://github.com/tobybridle/url-shortener)

**Chouten**  
[A multi-media consumption app created using an in-house cross-compatible extension format.](https://github.com/chouten-app/chouten-android-clean)

## üèÅ My Projects

Was I really supposed to list them here?  
They're literally *one* click away..  
I guess I can list a few

#### URL Shortener (WIP)
- A url shortener leveraging the power of Rust for the backend api, postgres and SvelteKit to join it all together - with a sprinkle of NGINX and Docker for
easy deployment of the application reverse-proxied to provide a seamless experience for the user.
- The functionality has all been added - I am now using Motion One along with the Web Animation API to create flawless animations
to "liven" up the page.  
**Find the project [here](https://github.com/TobyBridle/url-shortener)**

#### Stackz
- A shunting-yard compiler for a stack-based language. Compiles for ARM64 assembly. Find it [here](https://github.com/tobybridle/stakz-lang)
#### My Blog
- A blog page made using Gatsby & GraphQL. The old deployment is no longer available and due to breaking changes in the Gatsby API along with other dependencies, no longer works.
  However, you can find screenshots of how it looked **before** being shutdown on the repo **[here (repo)](https://github.com/tobybridle/ReactBlog)**
#### XO Online
- [A low-level, performant LAN-accessible tic-tac-toe game built using C and sockets](https://github.com/tobybridle/xo-online)
#### Todo
- A persistent Todo CLI made in Rust. Find it [here](https://github.com/tobybridle/todo)
#### Neovim Config
- Not so much a project, but still something I've put a lot of my time into. Find it **[here](https://github.com/tobybridle/neovim-config)**
