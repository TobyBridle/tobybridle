# Woah, fancy seeing you here! 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently working on a few things, most notably:
- **XO Online**  
[A socket game in C](https://github.com/tobybridle/xo-online)
- **BHASCODE**  
[A compiler, made in Rust, for a pseudocode language](https://github.com/tobybridle/bhascode)


### 🧠 To-be-confirmed projects left in my brain
- **~~`(REDACTED)`~~**  
An imaginary scraper site, similar to __[Saikou](https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou)__, using NextJS, Typescript and Tailwind as a way to get back into the frontend


### 🏁 My Projects

Was I really supposed to list them here?  
They're literally *one* click away..  
I guess I can list a few
